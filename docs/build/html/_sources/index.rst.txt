Welcome to our workshop infra docs!
=======================================================

Providing a frictionless experience for workshop participants with hands on, technical sections is key to focus on what is important - hands on learning and experimenting with new technology. 

It should be easy to work through the hands on labs no matter the operating system or hardware specification of your device.

   contribute

We need to be able to understand the technology we work with. In addition to the general awareness we want to make it simple for new colleagues to get started with the tools that we have in place. Hence documentation is key. Here is how you can contribute to our repository.
